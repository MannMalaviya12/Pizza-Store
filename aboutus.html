            <p>
                At Pizza Palace, we believe that great pizza starts with the finest ingredients and a passion for perfection. Our story began in 1985 when our founder, Tony, set out to create the best pizza in town. Since then, we've been serving up delicious pizzas that have become a favorite among our loyal customers.
            </p>
            <p>
                We take pride in using only the freshest and locally-sourced ingredients for our pizzas. Our dough is made from scratch daily, and we carefully select the finest toppings to ensure every bite is a burst of flavor.
